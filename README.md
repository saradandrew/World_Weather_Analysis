# World Weather Analysis

## Project Overview
This analysis uses weather description data retrieved using APIs and allows users to input desired temperatures so they may filter their preferences when choosing potential travel destinations and nearby hotels.

## Weather Database
The Weather_Database folder consists of the first part of this project. Within it is the Weather_Databased.ipynb notebook where the latitudes and longitudes, maximum temperatures, percent humidity, percent cloudiness, wind speeds, and weather descriptions were retrieved using an OpenWeatherMap API.

## Vacation Search
The Vacation_Search folder consists of the Vacation_Search.ipynb file. This notebook consists of several elements input statements for users to input their minimum and maximum temperature preferences and a marker layer map with pop-up markers. Each marker includes hotel name, city name, country name, and current weather description with the max temperature.

## Vacation Itinerary
In the final part of the project, Google Directions API was used to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities. I then created a marker layer map with pop-up markers for each city on the itinerary.
